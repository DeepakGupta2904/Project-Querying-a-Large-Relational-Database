# Project-Querying-a-Large-Relational-Database

I am done this project as a Data Scientist Intern at Intellipaat Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

Problem Statement:- How to get details about customers by querying a database?

In this project, I had work on downloading a database and restoring it on the server. You will then query the database to get customer details like name, phone number, email ID, sales made in a particular month, increase in month-on-month sales and even the total sales made to a particular customer.
